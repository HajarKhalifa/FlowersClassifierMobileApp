# Algorithm
1. Import necessary Flutter libraries and packages.
2. Define the main application class.
   - Set up the application's initial state.
3. Implement the user interface components, such as screens, buttons, and image capture functionality.
   - Create screens for capturing images and displaying classification results.
   - Add buttons and widgets for user interaction.
   - Implement image capture functionality using the device's camera.
4. Create functions to handle image processing and classification.
   - Define a function to preprocess the captured image for optimal input to the classification model.
5. Integrate the TensorFlow Lite model for flower classification.
   - Load the pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model into the application.
   - Configure the model's input and output tensors.
6. Define UI event handlers and callbacks for capturing images and displaying classification results.
   - Implement a function to capture an image from the device's camera.
   - Set up event listeners for buttons and user interactions.
   - Define a callback function to process the captured image and perform classification.
7. Configure the application's layout, styles, and navigation.
   - Define the layout of screens and widgets.
   - Apply styles and themes to enhance the user interface.
   - Set up navigation between screens.
8. Build and run the application on the Flutter simulator or a physical device.
   - Compile the Flutter code into an executable binary.
   - Run the application on the desired platform for testing and validation.
